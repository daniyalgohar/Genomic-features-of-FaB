## PhyloLM
The "Gene enrichment analysis.R" script is an R script designed to analyze gene gene enrichment patterns. It takes as input a gene count matrix,
a metadata table, and a phylogenetic tree. The script first applies a scaling transformation to the gene counts. The script then runs a model for 
each gene against each habitat, automatically processing the enrichments across habitats. It predicts the enrichment scores of each gene for each
habitat, providing valuable insights into gene expression patterns across different environments.
